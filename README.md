## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

It was my goal to buil aa webpage almost entirely with Bootstrap with minimal custom CSS. I had worked briefly with older versions of Bootstrap so it was a challenge getting to know version 5.

### Continued development

This project is still under construction. The desktop layout still has to be improved as well as the modal section. 


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - Easy to read and navigate, it helped me find what I needed faster and sped up my production.
